## Bytebot Architecture

Bytebot is designed as a single, integrated Docker container that provides both a desktop environment and the tools to programmatically control it.

## Core Components

### Container Base

- **Ubuntu 22.04** serves as the base operating system
- Provides a stable foundation for the desktop environment and tools

### Desktop Environment

- **XFCE4** desktop environment 
- Lightweight and customizable
- Comes pre-configured with sensible defaults
- Includes default user account: `bytebot` with sudo privileges

### Automation Daemon (bytebotd)

- **bytebotd daemon** is the core service that enables automation
- Built on top of nutjs for desktop automation
- Exposes a REST API for remote control
- Provides unified endpoint for all computer actions

### Browser and Tools

- **Firefox** pre-installed and configured
- Essential utilities for development and testing
- Default applications for common tasks

### Remote Access

- **VNC server** for direct desktop access
- **noVNC** for browser-based desktop access

## Communication Flow

1. **External Application** makes requests to the Bytebot API
2. **bytebotd daemon** receives and processes these requests
3. **Desktop Automation** is performed using nutjs 
4. **Results/Screenshots** are returned to the calling application

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  The default container configuration is intended for development and testing purposes only. It should **not** be used in production environments without security hardening.
</Warning>

Security aspects to consider before deploying in production:

1. The container runs with a default user account that has sudo privileges
2. Remote access protocols (VNC, noVNC) are not encrypted by default
3. The REST API does not implement authentication by default
4. Container networking exposes several ports that should be secured

## Customization Points

Bytebot is designed to be customizable for different use cases:

- **Docker base image** can be modified for different Linux distributions
- **Desktop environment** can be replaced with alternatives (GNOME, KDE, etc.)
- **Pre-installed applications** can be customized for specific testing needs
- **API endpoints** can be extended for additional functionality
