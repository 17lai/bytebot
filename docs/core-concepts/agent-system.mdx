## Agent System Overview

The Bytebot agent system extends the core desktop container with AI-driven automation capabilities. It's designed to execute tasks autonomously using a structured task management system, message-based interactions, and database persistence.

## Core Components

### Agent Service

The agent service is the central processing unit of the Bytebot agent system. Built with NestJS, it:

- Processes tasks in a structured loop
- Integrates with Anthropic's Claude for AI capabilities
- Manages the task state and messages
- Dispatches computer actions to the bytebotd service
- Provides a REST API for task management

### Task Management

Tasks are the primary unit of work in the Bytebot agent system:

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  status: TaskStatus;
  priority: TaskPriority;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING,
  IN_PROGRESS,
  NEEDS_HELP,
  NEEDS_REVIEW,
  COMPLETED,
  CANCELLED,
  FAILED
}

enum TaskPriority {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH,
  URGENT
}
```

The task lifecycle involves:

1. **Creation**: Tasks are created via the API or UI with a description
2. **Queuing**: Tasks are queued for processing using BullMQ
3. **Processing**: The agent processor handles tasks one at a time
4. **Completion/Cancellation**: Tasks are marked as complete, cancelled, or other terminal states

### Message System

The agent communicates through a structured message system using Anthropic's content block format:

```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string;
  content: MessageContentBlock[];
  role: MessageRole;
  taskId: string;
  summaryId?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum MessageRole {
  USER,
  ASSISTANT
}

interface MessageContentBlock {
  type: string;
  [key: string]: any;
}

interface TextContentBlock extends MessageContentBlock {
  type: "text";
  text: string;
}

interface ImageContentBlock extends MessageContentBlock {
  type: "image";
  source: {
    type: "base64";
    media_type: string;
    data: string;
  };
}
```

Messages are stored with their associated tasks and can be included in summaries for context retention.

### Database Structure

The agent system uses PostgreSQL for data persistence with a schema that includes:

- **Tasks**: Storing task metadata and status
- **Messages**: Storing conversation history using a JSON structure for content blocks
- **Summaries**: Storing context summaries for long-running tasks, with hierarchical relationships

### Queue System

The BullMQ-based queue system manages:

- Task processing jobs
- Retry logic
- Job prioritization
- Concurrency control

## Agent Processing Loop

The agent processing loop follows these steps:

1. **Fetch Task**: Retrieve the task and its associated messages
2. **Update Status**: Mark the task as in-progress
3. **Process Messages**: Send messages to the AI for processing
4. **Execute Actions**: Perform computer actions through the bytebotd API
5. **Store Results**: Save responses and action results
6. **Create Summaries**: Periodically summarize conversation context
7. **Complete Task**: Mark task as complete when finished

## Computer Action Integration

The agent leverages the unified computer action API to perform actions on the desktop:

1. The AI identifies required actions based on the task and conversation
2. The agent service sends computer action requests to the bytebotd daemon
3. The bytebotd daemon executes actions on the desktop
4. Results (including screenshots) are returned to the agent service
5. The agent integrates these results into the conversation

## Web UI Integration

The NextJS-based web UI provides:

- A chat interface for user-agent interaction
- Task management controls
- Real-time desktop view via embedded noVNC
- Task history and status views

## Security Considerations

When using the agent system, consider these security aspects:

- The agent has access to your desktop environment
- API keys (like ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) are required and should be secured
- Database persistence stores conversation history
- Network security for the additional exposed ports (9991, 9992)

## Customization and Extension

The agent system can be extended in several ways:

- Custom tools integration via the NestJS API
- UI customization through the NextJS frontend
- Additional AI model integration
- Workflow automation through the task system

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Agent not starting**: Check environment variables and database connection
- **Task processing errors**: Check the agent logs for error messages
- **UI connection issues**: Ensure all services are running and ports are accessible
- **Computer action failures**: Verify the bytebotd service is running and accessible
