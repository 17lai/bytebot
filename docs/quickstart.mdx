## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Bytebot, make sure you have:

- Docker installed on your system
- Sufficient system resources (recommended: 2+ CPU cores, 4GB+ RAM)

## Running Bytebot

Getting started with Bytebot is simple and straightforward.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="cube" title="Building the Docker Image">
    You can build the Bytebot Docker image using the provided build script:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build.sh
    ```

    For custom build options:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build.sh --tag custom-tag --no-cache
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="play" title="Running the Container">
    Once the image is built, you can run Bytebot using the provided run script:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/run.sh
    ```

    This will start Bytebot with default settings. The container exposes several ports:
    - `3000`: REST API and noVNC web access
    - `5900`: VNC server
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="display" title="Accessing the Desktop">
    You can access the Bytebot desktop environment in two ways:

    **Using a VNC Client**:
    Connect to `localhost:5900` with any VNC client.

    **Using a Web Browser**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/vnc` in your web browser for noVNC access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using the Computer Use API

The core functionality of Bytebot is programmatic control of the desktop environment through its API.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Terminal
# Example: Move the mouse to coordinates (100, 200)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/computer-use \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "move_mouse", "coordinates": {"x": 100, "y": 200}}'

# Example: Take a screenshot
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/computer-use \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "screenshot"}'
```

```python Python
import requests

def control_computer(action, **params):
    url = "http://localhost:3000/computer-use"
    data = {"action": action, **params}
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    return response.json()

# Move the mouse
control_computer("move_mouse", coordinates={"x": 100, "y": 100})

# Take a screenshot
screenshot = control_computer("screenshot")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const axios = require("axios");

async function controlComputer(action, params = {}) {
  const url = "http://localhost:3000/computer-use";
  const data = { action, ...params };
  const response = await axios.post(url, data);
  return response.data;
}

// Example usage
async function runExample() {
  // Move mouse
  await controlComputer("move_mouse", { coordinates: { x: 100, y: 100 } });
  
  // Take screenshot
  const screenshot = await controlComputer("screenshot");
  console.log("Screenshot taken:", screenshot);
}
```
