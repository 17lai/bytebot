## What is Bytebot?

Bytebot is a self-hosted AI desktop agent that transforms how you interact with computers. By combining powerful AI with a containerized Linux desktop, Bytebot performs complex computer tasks. Think of it as your virtual employee that can actually use a computer â€“ clicking, typing, browsing, and completing workflows just like a human would.
